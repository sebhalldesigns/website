            </h3>

            <p>
                I am an Engineering Student currently studying <i>Integrated Mechanical and Electrical Engineering</i>
                at the University of Bath. 
                This combines a wide range of fields ranging from Power Electronics to Vehicle Dynamics and Control Systems, providing a comprehensive engineering foundation.
                <br><br>
                Alongside my studies, I have spent time on a variety of projects that allow me to expand my knowledge and skills further. 
                Most of these involve Software Engineering, more recently focusing on Realtime and Embedded Systems.
